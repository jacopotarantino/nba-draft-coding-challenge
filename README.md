# NbaDraftCodingChallenge

## Caveats

* For the purposes of this challenge I will not be testing my code.
* I'm trying to get this done as quickly as possible so things like types will likely get glossed over.
* Included in the time it took to write this is the time for me to learn about the current state of Angular and Angular CLI.
* There was no JSON data provided for the players or teams so I stubbed them in the relevant service (didn't seem necessary to pull them even further out into mock files).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
